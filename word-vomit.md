You're just a machine pushing out whatever it takes in.
You only believe when something outside you tells you to.
There's no inner fire in fire there.
You're not in any control.
Even when your chin is high it's a fucking lie.

So fuck it. Gimme the mic and I'll spit my bullshit.

I fell too hard for this girl. The look in her eyes. The taste of her lips.
Better than drugs. What are you trying to say here?

Little recap for mental clarity:
Fucking Friday was amazing. Our date felt like some Ryan Gosling Notebook style bullshit.
It felt so good. I hate admitting that because I'm still scared of loosing her.
It feels like I've never wanted someone this badly. It's not looks either.
She gorgeous, but not the most amazing. It's everything about her and how it comes together. Look at you motherfucker. You got got. You're writing your feelings about a chick on a Sunday evening. It's time to harden the fuck up. You've got so much to prove. You're only getting older. Every second that passes is one you'll never get again. Every stroke of the clock is another inch closer to your last. Everyday those teleomeres are snipped. You are going to die. You are going to die alone. You can take that shit. Stop lying to yourself. The void is waiting for you with a patience that is beyond human. Where the fuck is the humor in this? How the fuck do you turn this into a joke? I'm a lovestruck, nihilist, tech-bro, psychopath waiting to die. When these hospice patients star off into the sky, gorked out on morphine, is God welcoming them to his kingdom?
What a stupid fucking question. No. THIS IS IT. One chance. No purpose. I fell so hard for this girl. I got into Outside Lands by some dude's impressive hustle. He had a couple employee wristbands. For a decent price and your DL as collateral he walks you through security. You pay cash from an ATM inside. He gives back your DL and you're on your way. I walked all fucking day after CrossFit and not eating just to see this bitch. Only to have her get drunk and put her phone on Airplane mode. So I blow up her phone like a retard and just get high and hangout with my friends. At least the music wasn't bad.

Holy shit do I feel inadequate. I guess that's why the lyrics about Thor assuming his destiny are motivating.

Don't call yourself a writer. How much time have you actually spent pressing these keys? Making words come alive on the page. Not long at all. Your thinking is fucking muddy. It's not even that muddy it's that when you commit your thoughts to the page you're being lazy. That's were the lack of clarity is coming from. So here's the fix. Mashing these stupid keys. You shine these motherfuckers until it's all chrome baby.

I hate that I got goosebumps thinking about traveling with Hollie while watching Radiohead live. Fuck me. It's only because of fear of rejection. It's beautiful when it's coming from her too. It's so trite and cliche, but that connection, love or whatever, is so worth celebrating. It's the most amazing feeling in the world. All the LSD in the world doesn't rock my shit like her smile does. Like right now I'm getting butterflies in my stomach and feel light-headed. What the ever loving fuck? Fuck her. You don't need anyone. You're a cold-as-steel, hard, motherfucker. Jokes. I'm trying to write jokes. There's nothing funny here. There's my anger, fear, and lovesick horseshit crowding this page. What is good art anyway?

Why is so much of the music that speaks to my soul not listened to by really hot women?
If you're above a seven and like slayer I will make happy in ways you can't possibly imagine.
